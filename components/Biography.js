      <div className="text-">Hello again! I&apos;m Dainyl Cua, and I love developing elegant, accessible, and useful tools for many. I started my coding journey helping my sister with her HTML and CSS on her profile page for ToonTownCentral - a forum page for our one of our favorite games. </div>
      <div>I graduated from Texas A&amp;M University in 2020 and learned to code in MATLAB for my numerical analysis class. Shortly after graduating, I started a consulting job which unfortunately fell through - but after that, I decided to pursue my true passion: coding.</div>
      <div>In April 2021 I started my software development journey and strengthened my fundamentals. In September, I joined General Assembly&apos;s Software Engineering Bootcamp and began developing 8-10 hours a day in multiple languages and tech stacks.</div>
